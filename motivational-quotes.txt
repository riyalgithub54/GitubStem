Arjun :- *_How can I get the best out of life?_*
Krishna:- *Face your past without regret. Handle your present with confidence. Prepare for the future without fear.*

Arjun :- *_What surprises you about people?_*
Krishna :- *When they suffer they ask, "why me?" When they prosper, they never ask "Why me?"*
